Education.Ly is a toolkit that offers youths with limited access to education and ongoing learning the opportunity to connect with teachers and students from various parts of the world to learn educational content. The toolkit offers educational videos on school subjects ranging from STEM courses (Sciences & Maths) but also other school subjects such as Geography, History and others. The subject content available on Educationaly ranges from Grade 9 - 12 and it is available at free of cost. We want to reach as many students as possible as we strongly believe in the power of education to grow the world.
